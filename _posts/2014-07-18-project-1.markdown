Tucker's passion for athletic training, organization of workouts, and attention to detail helped our girls basketball team get the best summer results I've seen in my five years of coaching.

Starting as the summer strength and conditioning for the Manson Northwest Webster girl’s athletic programs in 2014, I have continued to provide training plans for the MNW girl’s athletic teams during their athletic seasons. Focusing on basic strength and power development, we have seen great improvements in the athletic abilities of our athletes here. Staying in contact with the coaches online has allowed the MNW girl’s teams to keep a more consistent strength and conditioning routine during the year.
